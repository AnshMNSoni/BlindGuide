# Working Principle
The ATmega2560 continuously reads input signals from the ultrasonic sensor, LDR, and
SOS button.
- When the LDR detects darkness (low voltage output), the LED automatically turns
ON.
- When the SOS button is pressed, the buzzer activates to alert nearby people.
- The LCD displays the real-time status of the LED and buzzer.
- This integration of sensors and output peripherals provides an intelligent, responsive,
and power-efficient assistive solution.
